<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there! I’m Kshitij, but you can call me K. I’m a Computer Science BTech student with a passion for ethical hacking and web development. Every day, I’m sharpening my skills—breaking, fixing, and building things in the digital world.

</p>

<p>Right now, I’m running a startup called AuraStix, where we create high-quality stickers and posters. While I’m fully invested in growing the business, I’m also exploring content creation—because why limit myself to just one creative outlet?


Beyond tech and business, I’m a huge cinephile. Movies aren’t just entertainment for me; they’re a way to stay creative, inspired, and connected to different perspectives. I love diving into diverse genres, from thought-provoking indie films to mind-bending thrillers.

</p>
<p>Whether it’s coding, hacking, designing, or storytelling, I’m all about learning, experimenting, and pushing boundaries. Let’s connect and build something awesome!
